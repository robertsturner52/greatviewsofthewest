	  <p>Formerly a high school physics and geology teacher, I am now educating myself on how to create large and complex websites, so that I can create and manage a social sharing platform for those who are fascinated with the beauty of landscapes. Author of the Seven Laws of the Great View &copy;1995, and currently compiling a guide to the greatest views in the American West, I have come to realize that I will never be able to find all of the great views by myself. With an interactive website, I will be inviting interested participants to add their own favorite views, and together we can crowdsource our way to a more complete, if not quite definitive compilation of the grandest scenic viewpoints of our American West's magnificent landscape for all to share and enjoy.</p>
	  <p>I grew up in Washington, D.C., and graduated from UC Berkeley in 1975 with a degree in geology.  Currently I am editor of <i>Tehipite Topics</i>, the quarterly newsletter of the Tehipite Chapter of the Sierra Club, based in Fresno, California.</p>
