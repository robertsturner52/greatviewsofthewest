		<p><strong>The Seven Laws of the Great View</strong> — &copy;1995 Robert S. Turner</p>
		<p>(1)  The great view is always a ground-based view.</p>
		<p>(2)  The great view is enhanced by the method and path used to approach the view.</p>
		<p>(3)  The great view is enhanced by direct experience with geographical details within the expanse of the view.</p>
		<p>(4)  The great view is enhanced by knowing historical details about places within the expanse of the view.</p>
		<p>(5)  The great view is enhanced by geological knowledge, both structural and temporal, of the landscape within the expanse of the view. </p>
		<p>(6)  An ensemble of great views within sight of one another will enhance each great view.</p>
		<p>(7)  The great view both diminishes and expands the viewer's sense of self.</p>
